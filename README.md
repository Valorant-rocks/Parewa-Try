## Introduction

Parewa is a student-driven information delivery platform developed entirely by the students of Budhanilkantha School (BNKS). Designed to digitalize internal communication within the school and ensure an effective way to deliver essential notices, it serves as the school’s system for announcements, updates, and articles.

npm run dev
```

Then you will need to open `http://localhost:3000` with your browser to see the result.
You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Geist, a new font family for Vercel.
